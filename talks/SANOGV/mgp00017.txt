Coupling Principle Examples

Classic examples include Van Jacobson and Sally Floyd's work on the synchronization of various control loops, including routing updates and TCP (slow start synchronization) 
An important result of these observations is that coupling is closely related to synchronization
Injecting randomness into these systems is one way to reduce coupling -- This is the basis of RED/WRED, Various crypto methods, etc
Another important method for reducing a system's coupling is ensure that local changes have only local effect
