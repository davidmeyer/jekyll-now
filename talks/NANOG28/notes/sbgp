Once people do BTSH, I think the protocol itself is pretty safe.  The only
problem left is somebody hacking a BGP speaking router (they're doing this
already) and then using it so advertise rogue prefixes (not doing this
yet).  We can filter the small static guys with prefix lists.  We
can't filter the customers with 1000 routes that change on a daily
basis with prefix lists, must use AS path lists which don't stop
rogue prefixes.

Before we talk about ways to authenticate the origin, we need an
accurate/authoritative/secure source of information, as one does not exist
(RADB sucks).  We need to solve this problem as simply as possible, and
SBGP/SoBGP are not simple :(.

My 2 cents.
