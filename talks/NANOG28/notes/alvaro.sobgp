Some comments on the slides:

(1) It would be good if you take a look at the soBGP information:

ftp://ftp-eng.cisco.com/sobgp/index.html

Your view may be skewed by only knowing one of the solutions...

I added some comments below on the soBGP point of view.


(2) "Complexity..."

- soBGP also proposes the protection of AS/IP address allocation and
announce authority cryptographically.

- we don't talk about protecting the session/peerings because that's a
different part of the overall problem.  We are not against using
MD5/IPSec/whatever to protect them -- in fact, we stayed away from
specifying anything to guarantee futire flexibility.

- soBGP can also authenticate every step

...btw, the complexity is not only in the setup, but in the later
operation as well.   The difference between the two is how that operation
occurs.



(3) "10k-mile goal"

- In soBGP, any speaker can verify the address space allocation, that the
origin is valid and that the entire AS_PATH is valid.  The difference is
in the approach: we don't add overhead to the UPDATE messages by carrying
additional (but independent) information in them.  In other words, routers
that don't implement (or don't need to) soBGP don't have any additional
resource requirements (compared to today).

For example, for eBGP routes, you really only have to do the
authentication at the border...but by carrying attestations in the UPDATE,
then all the routers need (at least) extra memory.

In soBGP (because the UPDATEs don't carry attestations), no cryptographic
processing is needed when a new route/path is received -- just a check on
an already resolved table (including AS, authorization, etc.).


- The attributes can't be secured (i.e. guarantee that they haven't been
changed, except for the AS_PATH) because of the ability of any AS to
change them accorfing to local policy.  This is valid for SBGP as well.


- "...are there security implications of throwing everything into BGP?"

Yes...definetly.  But that's outside the scope of both soBGP and SBGP.



(4) "So what can or should we do?"

The "databse in the sky" idea (precomputing can be local) is what SBGP
wants to do...and you're right, the routing system may no longer be able
to come up by itself. :-(

We don't want to rely on routing to secure routing (specifically, use BGP
routes to reach a database that contains BGP routing security
information)...that's why soBGP carries all the certificates in a new
message in BGP itself!!  If your peer is reachable, then you can exchange
routes and security information.

A separate message allows you to have separate routes-only or
security-only sessions...reducing the memory burden, processing
requirements, etc. due to the additional info.

If the precomputing is done locally (inside the AS - that's the RADIUS
draft that Randy was refering to earlier), then only the resolved
information (authentication tree and topology graph -- no signatures,
keys, etc.) need to be stored in the routers.  Yes, this will take some
additional storage memory, but not significant processing.

After a restart, the security information can be learned the same way the
routes are: through the BGP session.

The effect on BGP convergence will always (for both proposals) be higher
at start-up (when the security information is learned) because on the
crypto operations.  Once that is resolved, SBGP still has an impact in
single route convergence because of the crypto stuff contained in each
UPDATE, soBGP doesn't.

As far as cost -- the infrastructure part is about the same (CA, etc.).
The router hw cost for soBGP doesn't necessarily require any additional
crypto hw.


(5) Administrative delay

What you described is the SBGP process...

In soBGP, the signatures and cerificates have to be generated (the same
way), but the propagation of this information is significantly different.
Instead of relying on out-of-band database syncs (maybe once or twice a
day...in the best case), the certificates are advertised in the new
Security Message.  This means that once a new block is allocated (and the
certificates created), the security information can be propagated to
everyone in the system at about the same speed as an UPDATE (no waiting
for databases to sync)...


(6) Alternate Position

We believe that BGP security has evolved over time by adding knobs, hacks,
etc...in response to point attacks.  In fact, all the existing knobs
(including btsh, etc.) can be enabled with at most coordination between
peers on a specific session -- many can be enabled by just one side and
still be effective (max-prefix, for example).

The missing link that we see is the validation of the origin (and the
path)...which is what soBGP is solving.  How much is enough and for how
long??  That's what you (the operators) have to answer! :-)  The problems
that SBGP and soBGP are trying to solve are not new...but it all depends
on the community wanting to solve them -- SBGP was first proposed about 4
years ago, and no one has shown any interest (until now) to do anything
w/it....


(7) Final Thoughts

Personally, I am not convinced that a signed UPDATE must the the final
objective.  In fact, all the people we've talked to about soBGP (i.e.
explained how it works, etc.) agree...

One more thing; soBGP doesn't sign any UPDATES.  Your slide reads
"signed-origin from sBGP" - I guess you're refering to soBGP.  Again, pls
take the time to at least learn about the alternative to SBGP before
completely dismissing it...


My 1c.

Alvaro.
