So what can or should we do?


How about....
Pre-collecting all of the published information into one local database and running authorization checks there
Only send a router this 'precompiled' chunk of data instead of everything  
But the router still need additional processing and memory to be able to handle this

Still: Its unclear how big this precompiled information would be, or how much of it a router will need when it restarts
How much do you need to cache on the router itself?  
You may no longer have a routing system that can come up by itself
