A few final thoughts


What are the cost/benefit tradeoffs are we looking at?

And is there an incremental deployment approach?

For example, can we start with signed-origin sBGP so the machinery is present for signed-AS_PATH in the future?

Note that soBGP doesn't sign UPDATES
Certificates are advertised in the new Security Message. 

Oh yeah, and convolve all of this with IPv6....
