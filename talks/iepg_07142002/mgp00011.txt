Coupling Principle Examples


Canonical examples include Van and Sally's work on the synchronization of various control loops, such as routing update synchronization and TCP Slow Start synchronization

An important result of these observations is that coupling is closely related to synchronization. 

Injecting randomness into these systems is one way to reduce coupling.

Another important method for reducing a system's coupling is ensure that local changes have only local effect.
