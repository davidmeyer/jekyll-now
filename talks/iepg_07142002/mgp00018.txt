My Perspective on our Current Trajectory


We must to find ways to control complexity, RSN
And BTW, it's all going the other way

We could easily cross a complexity barrier that puts fundamental limits on our ability to efficiently scale
Or causes the Internet to completely collapse
Or prevents IP transport from becoming a profitable business 
Or prevents us from reaching the performance levels we want
Or ...

BTW, possible complexity metric
