Well, there's SHIM6 and HIP in the "works"

However...
Those techniques work equally well for IPv4 *or* IPv6
Various difficulties as a technique for scaling the routing system 
Complexity
possibly irreducible?



Assertion: IPv6 offers little or no advantage over IPv4 in achieving locator/identifier split.
