What exactly was the IAB "edict"?
Noting effects of a severe Red Shift
IPng == CLNS (+ TP4) 
Or was it someting else
And what happened to the IAB mission ("psyche")?
More generally, is there an "IAB Culture"?
stewardship of that culture (if it exists)?
Effect of our proccess on this (NOMCOM)?

In any event, there are bunch of different IPv6 issues
Fixed length addresses
(Lack of) Abstraction Boundaries
/48 subnet
64 bit host id
