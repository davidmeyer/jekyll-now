Summary: Transport Network Requirements

Designed to carry L{1,2,3}VPN, and IP

IP/MPLS Control and Forwarding Plane
Mod what I said about "MPLSv2"

BT's requirement for an OOB Control Plane still being discussed 
NSIS's path-coupled/decoupled terminology has crept in here...

QoS requirements not yet jelled
But some are starting to look surprisingly like NSIS

Q: How is this different that the Internet again?
