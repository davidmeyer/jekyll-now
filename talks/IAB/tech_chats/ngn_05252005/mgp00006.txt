So, what problem are we trying to solve here?

Well, its the "SP Holy Grail"
OPEX reduction
Convergence onto a packet network
BTW, what's the theory here?
CAPEX efficiency
Again, convergence onto a packet network
New Top Line Revenue 
aka "Services"

BTW, what is our collective wisdom here?
C 1: The Internet Architecture leads (almost by definition -- e2e principle) to commodity packet carriage, and since in "quasi-open market" economies, the price of a commodity tends towards the incremental cost of providing the commodity, we can conclude that the margins on packet carriage will be small [Clark2003]
i.e., what is the incremental cost of forwarding a packet in the core of the network?
A very different approach, then, might be to build technologies that enable low margin packet-carriage businesses to be profitable.
And what about "routing $$" and the IETF mission?
