NGN Transport Requirements



Each mode is specified with its its own addressing, routing, signaling, OAM, QoS metrics and traffic descriptions
And these functions shouldn't be proxied by other "layer networks" (e.g., you shouldn't use the fact that your LDP session is gone to proxy for user-plane OAM in the PW).

I sense a tremor in the force....
Suffice it to say that the co-ps mode (MPLS) is contentious
