LSP Source Identifiers
IETF: The source identifier of an LSP (which is essentially the LSP access-point address) to be a function of the signaling protocol that created it.  e.g., an LDP signaled LSP uses a different source identifier to an RSVP-TE signaled LSP, v.
ITU: Y.1711 where the LSP source identifier is denoted by the 20 octet TTSI (Trail Termination Source Identifier) and this is specifically stated as decoupled from the control-plane [Y.1710] 

Sequence Numbers (PWE3 control word)
Argument here is that this is a hack as the co-ps mode should never misorder packets

Y.1710/Y.1711 v. LSP-Ping
