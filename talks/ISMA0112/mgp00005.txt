route-views.oregon-ix.net -- history


Circa 1995 
route-views started life as a purely operational tool
We needed a way to look how providers saw our routes

Looking glasses were still in the future

Randy Bush was kind enough to give us a view from MAE-WEST

People started using route-views and contributing views
But this caused things to really take off -->
