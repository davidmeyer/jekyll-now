Issue 1: End-System Complexity


The issue here, articulated by Vijay Gill, is basically that assuming an industry standard 2% churn/month on low margin customers, one support call can destroy the margin on that customer for the expected lifetime of the customer.

The concern here is that the dynamically changing ULIDs and locators will cause new and harder to diagnose problems, resulting in an increased frequency of calls to the help desk.
Which in will either hurt or destroy the margin on the customer
