What Sprint is Doing 


Idea: "Edge QoS" (aka eQoS)

Start with a congestion free core (no queues)

Do queuing (customer configured) on the edge box
Only on egress 
Using ACLs to avoid ToS bits (except for IPSec VPN)
IPSec VPN -- case TOS bits 
If those bits encrypted --> per CoS tunnels 
Need ToS bit export (to IPsec header) to use single tunnel

Note "problems"
Ingres v. egress
ACL scaling 
DoS
