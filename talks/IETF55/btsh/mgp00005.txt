A Little More Mechanism


Use a receive path ACL (e.g.) that only allows BGP packets to pass to the RP that have the correct <source,destination,TTL> tuple
i.e., TTL in the range 255-254 for directly connected peers


If the TTL is not in the range 255-254 
Punt the packet into low priority queue, log, or silently discard
