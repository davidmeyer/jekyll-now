Coupling Principle


The Coupling Principle states that as things get larger, they often exhibit increased interdependence between components

COROLLARY: The more events that simultaneously occur, the larger the likelihood that two or more will interact. This phenomenon has also been termed "unforeseen feature interaction" [Doyle and Willinger]

Coupling can be either horizontal (within a protocol layer) or vertical (between layers)
