Central Tenet #2


Access monopolies cease to exist
Say, due to the emergence of technologies like WiMAX 
or just competition in the access
Truth in advertising: We still don't have a (inexpensive) wireless technology that could deliver 100s (or even 10s) of HDTV channels 
well...

Competition makes it much harder (impossible?) to profitably field policy-based access networks
Why? Well, consider the cost (OPEX) of running one of these networks 
and given the complexity, its reliability

And there is no way your SP is going to be able to innovate at the same rate as the *entire Internet*
Consider the success of various "walled-garden" providers
