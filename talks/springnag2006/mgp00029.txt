Background and Context


I'd been spending a lot of time around things like
NGN and IMS 
http://www.1-4-5.net/~dmm/talks/NANOG33/ims
And studying complexity
http://www.1-4-5.net/~dmm/talks/NANOG26/complexity_panel
RFC 3439

Its all about controlling how networks are used
And in particular, its about tying (perceived) high margin application revenue directly to the packet transport (and...charge differently/prevent/degrade "over-the-top" services)
And given my background/sensibilities, I was/am skeptical

So I proposed a (hedge) strategy that became known as "Meyer's Telecommunications Perfect Storm " (TPS)
