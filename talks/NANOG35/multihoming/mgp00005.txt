Rules of Engagement

First and foremost,  we're here to listen to your comments and concerns

Second, let's make sure we keep the information flow going in a bi-directional fashion

During our discussions, please remember that 
IPv6 is being deployed
so the multi-homing problem for IPv6 must be solved
shim6 is about IPv6 
as opposed to IPv4 or other (future) version of IP
shim6 may not solve all needs for multi-homing in IPv6
rather, shim6 is designed to address the site multi-homing problem
