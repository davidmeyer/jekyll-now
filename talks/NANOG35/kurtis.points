I think slide 3 is really good now! Some additional comments at the  
end....

I am not arguing that we should hide the dissent. But I think we all  
have to realise that the IETF and the Internet by now is a state that  
_any_ technology proposal of similar size as shim6 will slit the  
community in half. I would love for us to all go have beer, talk  
things over, and walk away with a unanimous view. Unfortunately those  
days are gone. That said, I think the BOF is a really good idea, and  
I must say I really appreciate that you are willing to take the task  
on to set it up. If for nothing else at least we are raising  
awareness among the Nanog goers and in the future hopefully among the  
rest of the world.

I slightly disagree here. Simply put what is now on the slides are  
reality. The IAB has no influence over WG output. Saying anything  
else is giving false impressions and hopes. And I worry that THAT  
would make the IAB/IETEF even weaker in the future. Remember that  
this is hopefully not a one of excersise. Hopefully we can find other  
topics in other context that we can discuss, and we need to set some  
general expectations. But what I mostly worry for is below...

I have a suggestion for one more slide. As below.

So, what do _I_ expect out of this BOF? Unfortunately I can't attend  
so here are some remarks/statements


o SHIM6 is about a shim layer for IPv6. Not IPv4 or IPvFuture. IPv6.  
So if there are concerns that IPv6 is flawed in way <foobar>, that is  
an acceptable view but not in the context of shim6.

o "shim6 is not what operator <barfoo> thinks will scale". Fine.  
Neither will Longest prefix match. Pick one. Criticising shim6 is ok  
with me, please come up with an alternative. There certainly was no  
shortage of it in multi6 but at the same time consensus was that most  
of the stuff would never work in large scale.

o "IPv6 can't/won't be deployed". Fine, so this BOF is not for you.  
This is multihoming _for IPv6_.

o "IPv6 is broken". IPv6 is more addresses. Nothing more nothing less  
(from an ops POV). Yes there are a lot of other things that we should  
have solved, but didn't. Yes it might be time to start discussing  
what will come after IPv6 (_after IPv6, after_). Good idea. Probably  
a topic for an IAB BOF at the next Nanog/RIR meetings/whatever.

o "shim6 does not solve all needs for multihoming in IPv6". Certainly  
true. I don't think we have ever claimed that it was. The  
complementary solution is called PI space with some form of  
restrictions alternatively some relaxation of the rules for getting  
PA. It's an interesting discussion and certainly one worth having at  
the BOF. I would be really interested in the outcome.

o "My solution XYZ that I proposed to multi6 was superior, much  
better, cheaper, and would also have solved world-starvation, but the  
clueless WG chairs Kurtis&Brian refused to listen to me". We called  
for consensus on the list of proposal. Sorry, noone wanted to play  
with you. Though luck.

o Special case of above: "Proposal ZYX based on variation Y.598765 of  
geo-allocations would have worked". Every single geo-aggregation/ 
allocation proposal I have seen is based on a different economical  
model of the net than today. Unfortunately Peter L doesn't go to  
Nanogs anymore of I would have let him repeat the statements from  
Seoul. Chaining the network economics is harder than deploying IPv6  
worldwide and turning off IPv4.

o "shim6 breaks traffic-engineering". Partly it does, partly it  
doesn't. Any ISP that takes on a multihomed customer today takes a  
traffic engineering risk. They have no idea if they are going to be  
primary, backup or loabalancer for the customer. shim6 does not  
change that fundamental. The old saying of "you need to have the  
resource you sell" still holds. Yes, there is a long running  
tradition among ISPs/carriers to break that rules, but that is their  
problem. Sorry. Shim6 does affect their TE capabilities, true. But if  
I where a carrier I would not loose sleep.

o "shim6 is only for Ipv6 and we could have used the same solution  
for IPv4!". Alternatively multi6/shim6 was forbidden to work on a  
solution for v4/v6. Well. When I took over Thomas role as co-chair on  
multi6 I asked Randy and be basically said I would have enough of  
work to solve this for v6. I am pretty sure me and Brian also had  
this discussion with Randy when Brian became co-chair. It was never  
about "we should only specify this for v6 only" it was about taking  
on chunks we could manage. Last time this was up was at the charter  
discussion of shim6 in MPLS. I think I replied to whoever brought up  
the question that "we will solve this for v6 first. If it happens to  
work for v4, all the better". Looking back I am pretty glad Randy  
said what he did. Or we would still be trying to sort out that list  
of multi6 proposals.

o Summary. I think you could add a slide saying that along what Tony  
Li said to the list. If you are doing IPv6, shim6 is the only  
solution we have that we know scales. If you have a better idea it  
better be a quantum leap in graph theory (or whatever Brian calls it).

No I don't expect to be quoted on the above :-)

Again, I really appreciate the effort you are doing! But keep in mind  
that I have done this BOF at quite a few IETFs as multi6 co-chair.  
With much the same people. You really need to tie the tails of the  
cats to something or you will never be able to hurd them in a  
direction that is useful..:-( I am not against the idea of the BOF, I  
think it is a good idea, I just see the problem with preventing this  
from turning into the "IPv6 is broken and we knew it in Toronto"  
discussion....
