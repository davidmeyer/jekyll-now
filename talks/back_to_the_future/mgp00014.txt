Aside: Fallacy of Division


The logical fallacy of arguing that what is true for the whole is also true for the parts
i.e., Coupling can cause the emergent behavior of a system

In the study of economics...
This takes the form of assuming that what works for the aggregate, or macroeconomy, also works for parts of the economy, such as households or businesses

Example:
NaCl is safe to eat, so Sodium and Chlorine are safe to eat
