So, complexity...


First, realize that complexity of the sort I'm going to be talking about is not well understood/hard to quantify
We just don't have the tools (yet)

Our focus here is on the non-linearity inherent in large systems such as the Internet

Recent work in the dynamical and non-linear systems field suggests that a class of highly designed systems (such as the Internet) are "Robust yet Fragile" 
Sounds like a contradiction of sorts, doesn't it?
