Zebra and MRT data integrity
Code-base split into Zebra/Quagga
(RIB) dumper thread causes BGP keepalive timeouts
And is MRT's 1 second granularity sufficient?

eBGP Multi-hop & external events
Some routers don't do ebgp-multihop well
also makes it difficult to study events in the multi-hop path
So we're trying to reduce ebgp-multihop scenarios
