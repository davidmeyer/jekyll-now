We’re seeing multiple disruptions to data center networking
Sources of disruption
•Software defined networking
–Controller-based configuration management
•Automation based on cloud orchestration
–OpenStack, Quantum/Neutron
•Network function virtualization
–Network services deployed in x86 VMs
•Two-level (“overlay/underlay”) architectures
–Virtual switch overlay on tunneled substrate
•Parity for merchant silicon
–New vendors; cost/feature tradeoff
Barriers to adoption
•Old change management models are broken
–Responsibility split between automation and user
•Compliance and security
–Data flows are unpredictable
–Technology has outstripped security tools
•Heterogeneity
–Uneven support for multiple vendor systems (physical + virtual)
–Lack of virtual appliance provisioning
•Loss of information
–Abstraction & tunneling make it difficult to (e.g.) provide QoS
