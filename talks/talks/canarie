Dave:

Very much enjoyed your presentation you gave at IEPG.

One of the arguments we use for the design of CA*net 4 is to eliminate
current growing complexity of Internet. We propose to do this by giving the
end user complete control of the physical and IP layers of the network.
Complexity appeals to carriers as they can derive more revenues and limit
competition. Simplicity appeals to customers as they don't have the
resources to manage complex systems.

As every technology matures it increases in complexity and coupling.  The
analogy I like to use is to look at mainframe computers before the advent of
the mini-computer and PC.  In those days mainframe computers were becoming
increasingly complex with time sharing systems, job scheduling, IO control,
etc.  The mini-computer was a much simpler device - but more importantly it
allowed a researcher to have a dedicated computer for their specific task
and not be bothered by all the complexity of time sharing, etc

All the exciting events of the last 25 years in computing started with the
mini-computer ultimately culminating in the PC - the UNIX operating system,
GUIs, SUN networking, Internet, etc.

The architecture we are building for CA*net 4 is to try to emulate the
mini-computer concept in IP networks. Today IP carrier networks are like the
old main frame computers - central managed - complex command and control
operating systems - resource sharing etc.  With CA*net 4, routing AND
switching is under control of the end user, thereby necessitating a
inherently much simpler architecture.  The physical path whether it is dark
fiber and/or wavelengths is physically owned and controlled by the end user.
They can also do their own peering with similar liked minded users with no
permission required from IP carrier.

PS Would you be interested in giving a talk at your paper at our annual
advanced networks workshop - www.canarie.ca?
