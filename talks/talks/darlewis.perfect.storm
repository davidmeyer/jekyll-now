Slide 8:

'lower opex'  this seems like a qualitative, undefined value.  Can you give examples of opex as a function of total revenue/profit for other low margin industries?  Groceries, appliances, etc.

Note also that there are examples of brand value and upselling even in comodities that allow for diferentiation and higher profits....

Example: whole foods found a niche where people would pay more for organic foods.  

GE introduced 'green' appliances that also allowed them to charge more/generate higher profits.

So anyway, I'm not denying that if profits are slim, you optimize towards increasing it by squeezing expenses (increasing efficiency).  But innovation is always an option in a healthy  busness.  In the SP world this has usually been seen in increasing aggrigation density (@home had a breakthrough in broadband density that allowed it to squeeze more efficiency).

I think the first point - the hypothesis - needs to be further developed. It seems rather simplistic.

I suggest taking your 'aside' slides 12/13 and moving them into something that supports/defines your hypothesis.

Slide 11:

Convolution - really mean that term?  So functions A and B are describing that overlap C?  That's not specifically called out in your slide.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution

Slide 15:

Be carefull, things have changed in the market here.  I think this slide was used by Geoff in a highly questionable way.  I don't think the data supports the concusions that geoff made verbally.  The data on this slide doesn't reflect the contention that these company's have problems getting capital!

Slide 18:

This is a key slide.  It kind of comes out of no where.  I think the presentation would benefit from an agenda slide where you first define TPS... This is point #2 right?

Slide 22/23:

These asides are valuable, but I think it will help the flow of the presentation if you incorporate them into the topic itself.  


Slide 24:

Same comment as slide 18, would help to organize the preso and call out that this is TPS requirement #3 or whatever.

Slide 26:  

this strawman comes out of no where - which of the 3 TPS areas does v6 drive?  I think it may be better just to review how v6 relates to this... 

Slide 27:

Good summary, but very wordy slide - might want to use ordered #s instead of just a pile of bullets.  (steal dino's slide formats!)

Slide 30:

I don't believe that you can draw the conclusion based on the data you've shown that suppliers to low margin business's have to maintain low margins themselves.  Classic counter example is Boeing/Airbus.  I would submit that the same lack of competition in access that exists in the router space allows us to avoid profit errosion....

Slide 32:

Regulatory systems that require commodity providers (like electricity) to implement service also allow for profit magrins/relief.  


Those are my thoughts.... Hope you get something from them. :)
