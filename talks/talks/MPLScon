Hi David,
I recently saw your white paper on Sprint and MPLS and wanted to invite you
to participate at MPLScon Fall 2002, to be held in Denver, CO on October
7-10.  I wanted to see if you would be interested in either a 30 minute
presentation based on your paper, or being a part of a round-table
discussion with the below abstract (or both).

-----------
Beer & Pizza Shootout - MPLS vs. ATM take 2!
Tuesday, October 8, 7-9 PM
During our first shootout in March of 2001 panel members discussed the role
of MPLS in service provider networks predominantly based on ATM. The key
topic of discussion focused on MPLS's ability (or inability) to provide
"hard" QoS guarantees, as well as resiliency comparable to current ATM
service offerings. Join us for a free-wheeling, no-holds-barred discussion
as we revisit this topic with a particular emphasis on answering the
following questions:
 What is the vision among service providers for the role of MPLS?
 What impact do changing market realities have on carrier momentum toward
MPLS?
 Is there still a role for cells?
 Are MPLS/IP QoS guarantees sufficient to support applications such as
voice?
 Is the future of ATM encapsulation within MPLS?
-----------

Please let me know if you would be available to join us for this event.  I
look forward to the opportunity to have you present a divergent view from
the current conventional wisdom within the MPLS community.

Sincerely,
Irwin Lazar
