Central Tenet #3


Third piece of this puzzle is that you get a set of peer-to-peer (p2p) applications that attack the incumbents revenue streams 
"attack" in the capture-the-revenue sense (contrast DDOS)
Key: p2p decentralization

Starting with voice
Large easily attacked revenue stream
cf. Vonage, skype, etc...
But also video, FMC, presence, IM, ...

So this (again) is about a convolution of our technology with public policy
