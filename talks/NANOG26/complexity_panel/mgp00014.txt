Aside: Horizontal vs. Vertical Coupling


Much of the non-linearity observed in large systems is due to coupling

This coupling has both  horizontal and vertical components 

In the context of networking, horizontal couping is exhibited within the same protocol layer, while vertical coupling occurs between layers
