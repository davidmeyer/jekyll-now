Introduction


So what is this panel about?
The growing complexity of Internet technology
And its implications

Goal: Socialize the understanding of complexity in the Internet Engineering Community
Both in what we build, and what we write (e.g. IETF)

So maybe this panel should be entitled: "Wake up and smell the complexity"
