One of the things that we at VZ are interested in is sampling vs accounting
based on BGP data.  For example, sampling gives you flow data, which may or
may not be useful to a provider.  What is often useful is
AS-pair/POP-pair/Router-pair aggregate flows, something that sampling has
been traditionally poor at doing without lots of back-end work.  

Furthermore, what sampling has not traditionally provided was some kind of
selectivity mechanism, whereby in order to increase the sample space while
at the same time not killing your router flow processing capability, you
predetermine the subset of traffic passing through your router from which to
sample from.  This is something on the horizon, but it is likely that it
need be done based on changing business requirements in real time (billing
vs DoS tracking vs Traffic Engineering, etc).

On the other hand, there are new accounting techniques that allow providers
to selectively and accurately account for traffic patterns based on routing
data rather than addressing information (important distinction).  For
example, and I will try and maintain vendor impartiality, I can now set up
accounting policies based on all kinds of BGP attributes in a deterministic
way.  So, if I need POP to POP data, I can account based on BGP communities
for the POPs, or confed sub-AS, or routert-id, or whatever.  This is in
contrast to some of the current mechanisms in place (such as MPLS LSPs or
sampling with offline coalescence tools).  Furthermore, these mechanisms do
have a close congruence to Diffserv (for whatever that is worth) in that
they are behavioral aggregates.  The cool thing (for you Dave ;) ) is that
it does NOT require MPLS.

As an operator, I think that the routers need to be more flexible in what
kind of data they can provide, in a way that is both accurate as well as
succinct.

So, I'm clearly on the "Ops" (vs. "research") side of things and I'm
guessing you're representing the other side of the coin (and Jen, too?)

The things I think that might be interesting from that side are
thoughts about sampling, since it won't be possible to count every
packet, and reductive approaches to topology to get a reasonable suss
of what kinds of things are important to model and which can be
disregarded.  Don't know if that last part makes sense or is
legitimate but it's something that came to mind.  In all this stuff,
it seems, there has to be some reduction so that the actual numbers
and nodes which are addressed are just proxies for what you're really
trying to measure.

On a different note, I don't find it useful to really get into routing
measurements, unless there's something I'm not thinking of.
If the idea is routing table growth w/in a given network, that's good
to keep track of, but not terribly difficult.  If it's different
things about the global table, that's interesting research fodder and
I'm glad the numbers and study results are available, but it doesn't
affect carriers day-to-day or otherwise really.

Dave,

> So you're on the hook for that [PSAMP, greater ubiquity], ok?

Sure, will do.

> What does the "wish list" look like (can we construct such a list)

One high-level "wish" is that measurement be treated as a first-class
citizen and not the afterthought that it has traditionally been.  By
that I mean that measurement should be in mind when protocols and
equipment are designed.  But, this is a "wish" that is too broad and
vague, and difficult to realize since we cannot start over and do a
"design for measurability" for IP and the other higher-layer protocols.

Instead, it would be good to have more ubiquitous support for
collecting relatively fine-grain data about usage, performance, 
and routing, while remaining conscious that collecting and
transporting the measurement data should not impede the correct
and efficient operation of the equipment and the network.  So,
we have to consider techniques like filtering, aggregation, and
sampling to reduce the amount of work required to collect the
measurement data and the sheer volume of the data.  With this
in mind, it would be great to have

  - ubiquitous standard support for packet sampling on line cards 
      and/or third-party devices (with the sampling tunable to 
      the tolerable overhead and desirable accuracy, and support
      for filtering to focus just on packets of interest)

  - continuous real-time view of routing data (e.g., current BGP
      routes, OSPF/IS-IS topology and weights, etc.) without having
      to "dump" periodically from the router

Together, these two types of data could provide a "network-wide"
(e.g., AS wide) view of traffic, topology, and routing to guide
a variety of operational tasks.  Going beyond a single AS (or
set of related ASes) it would be great to have

  - diverse collection of BGP feeds from different vantage points,
       and analysis tools build on these feeds to detect anomalies
  - platforms for controlled experiments in routing (e.g., injecting
       update messages for a small set of prefixes)
  - platforms (like NIMI) for measuring and characterizing end-to-end
       paths

> does it differ for the researchers and ops folks?

I think so.  A lot of researchers would like to have measurement data
from a small number of interesting vantage points (e.g., packet or
flow traces of a given link, or BGP tables from a few locations).  A
more network-wide view is needed for many operational tasks.  Also,
many researchers in the measurement area focus on inference and
end-to-end issues where you do not have (and cannot have) access to
the underlying infrastructure.  Operations folks, instead, often have
additional information and much more access to the infrastructure.
(An exception to this "research vs. ops" distinction I'm drawing are
the growing number of researchers interested in operations issues.
These folks would love simply to have access to the kinds of data that
operations folks already have, or could have in the future.)

In terms of how folks would use the data, I think that researchers
would tend to want public feeds of data and public distributed
measurement platforms for characterizing the traffic, performance, and
routing.  Operations folks may view the feeds differently, in terms of
detecting and diagnosing problems as they arise.  In both cases,
better distributed measurement efforts for routing and performance
data would be a big help.  Live, online access to the data would be
key for ops folks, whereas researchers might be happy with offline
access to archives of such data.

that's of major importance. one of the goal of having this panel
