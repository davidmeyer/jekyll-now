So what is "Peering" anyway?


SIP peering is defined to be a layer 5 peering between two administrative domains for purposes of routing real-time (or quasi-real time) session signaling between their respective customers.  
Note that media streams associated with this signaling (if any) are not constrained to follow the same set of paths.

BTW, what is "Layer 5"?
and does it include "Layer 3"?
