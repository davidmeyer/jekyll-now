SPEERMINT Charter


SPEERMINT focuses architectures to identify, signal, and route delay-sensitive (real-time) communication sessions. 
These sessions use the SIP signaling protocol to enable peering between two or more administrative domains over IP networks. 


Note that where these domains peer, or meet, the establishment of trust, security, and a resistance to abuse and attack are in scope.
