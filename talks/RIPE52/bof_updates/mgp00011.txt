Issues from APRICOT 2006


One important "Stat" about the APRICOT BOF
Had relatively few participants from the region



Session not very interactive
As a result, not too much discussion of shim6


Dissussion issues included
RIRs and address allocation issues
Future routing and addressing architectures
