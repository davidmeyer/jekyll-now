Issue 3: Inbound Traffic Engineering


First off,  in a shim6 context, inbound TE won't be solved by shim6 itself but by  an extra component that dynamically manages shim6's preferences. 

And that component can use a site wide policy set by the site's operator. 

Future work item for the shim6 WG


That being said...
