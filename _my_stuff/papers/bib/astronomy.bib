abstract={Mercury is locked into a 3/2 spin-orbit resonance where it rotates three times on its axis for every two orbits around the sun1,2,3. The stability of this equilibrium state is well established4,5,6, but our understanding of how this state initially arose remains unsatisfactory. Unless one uses an unrealistic tidal model with constant torques (which cannot account for the observed damping of the libration of the planet) the computed probability of capture into 3/2 resonance is very low (about 7 per cent)5. This led to the proposal that core--mantle friction may have increased the capture probability, but such a process requires very specific values of the core viscosity7,8. Here we show that the chaotic evolution of Mercury's orbit can drive its eccentricity beyond 0.325 during the planet's history, which very efficiently leads to its capture into the 3/2 resonance. In our numerical integrations of 1,000 orbits of Mercury over 4{\thinspace}Gyr, capture into the 3/2 spin-orbit resonant state was the most probable final outcome of the planet's evolution, occurring 55.4 per cent of the time.},

abstract={The Antikythera Mechanism is an intricate bronze construction discovered damaged and fragmented in the wreck of a cargo ship off the Greek island of Antikythera in 1900. Made towards the end of the second century BC, it contains 30 bronze gear wheels and many astronomical inscriptions. The mechanism is technically more complex than any known device for at least a millennium afterwards. It acted as a lunar--solar calendar, but its specific functions have remained controversial. Now a joint British--Greek team has reconstructed the device based on surface imaging and X-ray tomography of the surviving fragments. The reconstruction shows how the gears worked, and doubles the number of deciphered inscriptions. The Mechanism seems to have been a sophisticated predictor for the Sun/Moon/Earth system, and can justifiably be claimed as the world's oldest known analogue computer.},

abstract={The Antikythera Mechanism, an ancient Greek astronomical calculator, has challenged researchers since its discovery in 1901. Now split into 82 fragments, only a third of the original survives, including 30 corroded bronze gearwheels. Microfocus X-ray Computed Tomography (X-ray CT) in 2005 decoded the structure of the rear of the machine but the front remained largely unresolved. X-ray CT also revealed inscriptions describing the motions of the Sun, Moon and all five planets known in antiquity and how they were displayed at the front as an ancient Greek Cosmos. Inscriptions specifying complex planetary periods forced new thinking on the mechanization of this Cosmos, but no previous reconstruction has come close to matching the data. Our discoveries lead to a new model, satisfying and explaining the evidence. Solving this complex 3D puzzle reveals a creation of genius---combining cycles from Babylonian astronomy, mathematics from Plato's Academy and ancient Greek astronomical theories.},
