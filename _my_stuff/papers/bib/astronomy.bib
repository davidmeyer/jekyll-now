abstract={The Antikythera Mechanism is an intricate bronze construction discovered damaged and fragmented in the wreck of a cargo ship off the Greek island of Antikythera in 1900. Made towards the end of the second century BC, it contains 30 bronze gear wheels and many astronomical inscriptions. The mechanism is technically more complex than any known device for at least a millennium afterwards. It acted as a lunar--solar calendar, but its specific functions have remained controversial. Now a joint British--Greek team has reconstructed the device based on surface imaging and X-ray tomography of the surviving fragments. The reconstruction shows how the gears worked, and doubles the number of deciphered inscriptions. The Mechanism seems to have been a sophisticated predictor for the Sun/Moon/Earth system, and can justifiably be claimed as the world's oldest known analogue computer.},

abstract={The Antikythera Mechanism, an ancient Greek astronomical calculator, has challenged researchers since its discovery in 1901. Now split into 82 fragments, only a third of the original survives, including 30 corroded bronze gearwheels. Microfocus X-ray Computed Tomography (X-ray CT) in 2005 decoded the structure of the rear of the machine but the front remained largely unresolved. X-ray CT also revealed inscriptions describing the motions of the Sun, Moon and all five planets known in antiquity and how they were displayed at the front as an ancient Greek Cosmos. Inscriptions specifying complex planetary periods forced new thinking on the mechanization of this Cosmos, but no previous reconstruction has come close to matching the data. Our discoveries lead to a new model, satisfying and explaining the evidence. Solving this complex 3D puzzle reveals a creation of genius---combining cycles from Babylonian astronomy, mathematics from Plato's Academy and ancient Greek astronomical theories.},
