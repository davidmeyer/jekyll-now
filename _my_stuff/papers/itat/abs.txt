While advanced technological and biological systems have very
different implementations at the molecular and component levels,
they show surprising similarities in systems-level organization.
In fact, Systems Biology can inform network engineering as to
system-level architectural features that imbue advanced
engineered systems with scalability, adaptability and
evolvability. Perhaps surprisingly, convergent evolution in both
domains produces modular architectures that are composed of
elaborate hierarchies of protocols and layers of feedback
regulation in response to the demand for robustness to uncertain
environments. These somewhat paradoxical features are neither
accidental nor artificial. Rather, they derive from a deep and
necessary interplay between complexity and robustness,
modularity, feedback, and fragility. This paper explores insights
from both biological systems and theory that can help inform the
design and deployment of engineered systems such as the Internet
as well as helping to describe why some technologies are
difficult to evolve and hence deploy.
