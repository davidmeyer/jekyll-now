Allocation Policies

Significant cognitive dissonance in the community about	how to allocate IPv6 chunks
See the ppml mailing list (for example)

Summary
Some folks claim RIR policies are too restrictive and thereby stifle both deployment uptake and innovation
Others claim that proposed allocations are too big and thus violate stewardship principles
And BTW, what the heck is all this HD ratio stuff?
RFC 3194 (and what about RFC 3177?)
HD = log(#hosts)/log(#addresses)
Debate: HD ~ 0.8
BTW, physics "assigned" later (2005-04-11-IPv6-HD.pdf, ARIN Public Policy Meeting)

And what about the ITU's proposal(s)?
