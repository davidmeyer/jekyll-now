KEVIN, how do they look to you?  anything proprietary or of a patent issue here?  The only thing that would give me concern is the schematic.

Dave, that's why my VCR blinks "12" and yours doesn't.  You know that stuff.  You are the best one to tell if its proprietary or not.  If that's the case, I have no problem with it.  Thanks for the feedback.

How could that be? You could traceroute and figure it out. Well,
let me know.

>> the schematic. 

BTW, in the unlikely event that we aren't clear about how
traceroute (e.g. the internet) works, consider the
following. First, I'll just assert that there is nothing
proprietary or even remotely related to any patent in the
picture. This must be true, since the information is be easily
available from any computer on the floor (in fact, with LSR
traceroute, you don't even have to be on the floor). Here is an
example of how the link is traced (the example is actually from
the conference floor): 

nanog26-gw#trace www.sprint.com

Type escape sequence to abort.
Tracing the route to www.sprint.com (65.173.211.241)

  1 sprint1-gw.sprintlink.net (198.32.165.2) [AS 1239] 0 msec 0 msec 0 msec
  2 sl-bb23-tac-2-3-155M.sprintlink.net (144.232.19.65) [AS 1239] 8 msec 4 msec 4 msec

This is *public* information, and gets you all the information in
my picture (that sprint might be concerned with). But you can get
much more of the topology  information by just letting the
traceroute run, e.g.  

  3 sl-bb20-tac-5-0.sprintlink.net (144.232.17.173) [AS 1239] 8 msec 16 msec 8 msec
  4 sl-bb20-sea-8-1.sprintlink.net (144.232.18.42) [AS 1239] 4 msec 12 msec 4 ms
....

So this simply can't be an issue (can it?).

Charles,

There is nothing proprietary here.  In general, IP architectures at 
this level of detail are publically visible with the standard tools 
that are part of the TCP/IP protocol set (e.g. traceroute).

In any case, what is shown is not actually Sprint's network but the 
customer parts.

Chase
