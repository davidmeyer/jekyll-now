So, where is this complexity coming from?


Lots of sources. I'll focus on...Non-linearity inherent in large systems such as the Internet

Relatively recent work in the dynamical and non-linear systems field suggests that highly designed systems (such as the Internet) are "Robust yet Fragile" 

Sounds like a contradiction of sorts, doesn't it?
