Folks,

First, thank you for taking a look at the S-BGP technology.

Here's a strawman plan for the workshop.  All feedback is welcome.

There are a few Issues below about the plan itself, and a couple
Questions about information folks will need to provide to obtain the
S-BGP authorizations (certificate) that is required to get everything
set up.

		 Strawman Plan for the S-BGP Workshop

Overview
========

As Randy suggested, we will make the software available a couple of
weeks in advance of the workshop.  There will be S-BGP software for
"routers", PKI tools, etc., along with the related configuration
information and data needed to begin testing.  We ask that the
participants install the software on their laptops beforehand.  Folks
can also make preliminary tests and try peering with other (non-S-BGP)
routers that you have at your site.

The sections below cover:

Background Information
======================

Background information on S-BGP is available at Randy's web site:

  http://psg.com/~randy/sbgp
	IETF44.pdf			March 99
	NDSS00.pdf			February 00
	Kent_CIP.pdf			June 00
	S-BGP_Clarke_workshop.pdf	January 02

and a draft of the S-BGP protocol specification is available at BBN's
S-BGP web site:

  http://www.ir.bbn.com/projects/s-bgp/draft-clynn-s-bgp-protocol-00a.txt
					December 01

Familiarity with the background information will be assumed.


S-BGP Components
================

There are several software components that we will play with.

1) The S-BGP router code was integrated into MRT version 2.2.2 Alpha
   [05/03/00] on a FreeBSD platform, so most of the testing to date
   has been done there.  It uses OpenSSL to provide software crypto.
   S-BGP uses the native OS IPsec implementation of ESP in
   authentication-only mode to protect the TCP peering sessions.
   (We can omit using IPsec to make things easier for the red team :-)

   The S-BGP code is known to compile on at least one version of
   Linux, and MRT compiles on many platforms, so we do not expect
   problems on different platforms that the participants might have.

   We propose to use MRT's User Interactive Interface (UUI) to examine
   the routing table to see what routes were or were not accepted, and
   to use log files to illustrate what might be, e.g., reported to a
   NOC.

2) The NOC Tools are used by a NOC to manage the S-BGP infrastructure
   (public key certificates, address attestations, policy, etc.)

   The NOC Tools are written in Java (including jaas, jce, jsse, the
   HTTP servlet, etc.) and uses the Getronics C++ Certificate
   Management Library (CML) and a MySQL database. The software was
   developed on Windows 2000; we expect to have it running on
   Linux/Unix before the workshop.

3) There is the free-ware Certification Authority software BBN
   contributed under the DARPA CHATS program.  It was released for
   RedHat SE Linux 7.2 (and is known to run on 7.3) with a CrpytoFlex
   (RSA-only) hardware token (or a high-assurance BBN manufactured
   hardware token).  It interfaces to a Postgres database (standard on
   RedHat Linux).

   We propose that the workshop operate the CA without SE protection,
   using software crypto provided by OpenSSL.  (Does the red team want
   to try attacks against the CA?)

   Note that this piece will not be available on platforms other than
   Linux; the OpenSSL CA functionality can be used as a replacement by
   those that do not run Linux on their laptop.

4) There is the S-BGP Repository, a distributed global database, that
   holds the Certificates, CRLs, and address attestations (authorized
   originating AS information) uploaded by each NOC.  Each Repository
   instance synchronizes with the others so that a NOC only needs to
   interact with a single instance.  It uses Apache/ModSSL/OpenSSL,
   the CML, and a Postgres database.

   It is not necessary for each participant to have their own copy of
   the Repository.  BBN will have one available via the Internet for
   use before the workshop.

   Since the synchronization functionality has not been well tested,
   so we will use a single instance at the workshop.


Example Topology
================

I suspect, given that most laptops only have one network interface,
that the physical topology will essentially be a hub into which
everyone plugs their machine.  We can then, using multiple IP
addresses per interface, if the OS supports it, overlay one or more
logical topologies.  Here is a small candidate topology that can be
used to illustrate several of S-BGP's capabilities, including
incremental deployment.  It can be extended to include all the
participants as needed.

         +-+             +-+             +-+
         |A|------1------|B|------2------|C|---------3-----+

          |               |               | / 8            |
         +=+             +-+             +-+               |
         :G:-------5-----|F|------6------|E|---------7-----+
         +=+             +-+             +-+

                       Figure 1.  Example Topology

Each box, A through H, represents an AS, and the lines 1 through 12,
represent the interconnecting links.  ASes A through F are running
S-BGP, while G and H are not running S-BGP.  An AS contains one or
more routers.

Functionality that the topology can be used to explore includes:

    full use of S-BGP route and address attestations to select routes,
	using ASes with multiple peer ASes and alternate paths between
	the ASes;
	
    aggregation of the subnet allocated to D into C's less-specific
	prefix;

    aggregation of routes from two of B's peers and advertisement of
	the aggregate to B's other peer;

    interconnection of non-S-BGP capable ASes with S-BGP capable ASes,
	and using S-BGP in a detect-and-report mode (e.g., before all
	routers that make routing selections are S-BGP capable).

	G represents an AS that has not yet enabled S-BGP based route
	selection in all its BGP speakers, as would be the case during
	incremental deployment of S-BGP functionality to an AS's
	routers.  However, G can be checking purported originating
	ASes in UPDATE messages against the authorized originating AS
	information (from address attestations) provided by the NOC.
	It can also be checking in-band path authorizations (route
	attestations), if desired.  It can report anomalies to the NOC
	for logging or for further investigation.  This "passive mode"
	can be used to let the operations staff observe what S-BGP
	would do, and become familiar with S-BGP and how it operates.

	We learned that the capability of passing S-BGP route
	attestations between non-contiguous S-BGP islands and trying
	to specify policy to accommodate the gap resulted in a very
	complicated policy, both to define and implement.  Consequently,
	we no longer support that functionality.  We do not view this
	as a problem as the major ISPs are well connected so an
	expanding wave model of incremental deployment seems adequate;

    demonstrating the ability of an S-BGP speaker in C, D, or E to not
	send S-BGP route attestations to a router in H that does not
	yet have sufficient memory to store them, as may be the case
	for some BGP customers or peer ASes.

    learning how S-BGP supports a multi-homed customer, D, that does
	not provide transit service.

	D's addresses may be obtained either:
	  a) directly from an RIR, or
	  b) from a "portable" sub-block of one of its providers,
	     e.g., C.

	D can be configured in three ways to explore multi-homing
	issues (including the "prefix class" functionality provided to
	control UPDATE expansion):
	  A) it can be running S-BGP,
	  B) it can be running BGP, or
	  C) it is not running any inter-domain routing protocol.

Suggestions for alternate topologies or other functionality you wish
to see demonstrated are welcome.

				   
Red Team
========

S-BGP is designed to provide mechanisms that allow verification of the
correct operation of BGP:

  1) Each UPDATE received by a BGP speaker from a peer was sent by the
     indicated peer, was not modified en-route from the peer, and
     contains routing information no less recent than the routing
     information previously received for the indicated prefixes from
     that peer.

  2) The UPDATE was intended for receipt by the peer that received it.

  3) The peer that sent the UPDATE was authorized to act on behalf of
     its AS to advertise the routing information contained within the
     UPDATE to BGP peers in the recipient AS.

  4) The entity with the right to use an address space corresponding to
     a reachable prefix advertised in an UPDATE was given custodianship
     of that address space by a higher-level/parent entity.

  5) The originating AS was authorized, by the entity(s) with the right
     to use address space corresponding to the set of reachable
     prefixes, to advertise those prefixes.

  6) If the UPDATE indicates a withdrawn route, then the peer
     withdrawing the route was a legitimate advertiser for that route,
     prior to its withdrawal.

  7) The peer that sent the UPDATE correctly applied the BGP rules and
     its AS's routing policies in modifying, storing, and distributing
     the UPDATE, in selecting the route, and in deriving forwarding
     information from it.

  8) The BGP speaker that received the UPDATE correctly applied the BGP
     rules and its AS's routing policies in determining whether to
     accept the UPDATE.

    The countermeasures developed for S-BGP meet the first six of these
  criteria, even in the face of subversion of BGP speakers (Byzantine
  failures).  However, because the local policy features of BGP allow a
  speaker considerable latitude in determining how to process an
  UPDATE, these countermeasures cannot meet the last two criteria,
  i.e., such attacks could be attributed to local policies not visible
  outside the AS.  To address such attacks within BGP, the semantics of
  BGP itself would have to change.  Moreover, because UPDATEs do not
  carry sequence numbers, a BGP speaker can generate an UPDATE based on
  old information, e.g., withdrawing or reasserting a route based on
  outdated information.  Thus the temporal accuracy of UPDATEs, in the
  face of Byzantine failures, is enforced only very coarsely by these
  countermeasures.

I think that attacks directed at 1 through 6 are fair game, as would
be active attacks against the UPDATE messages (that could be
introduced by a compromised [S-]BGP speaker).

In addition, S-BGP has introduced new components into the
infrastructure, e.g., the NOC Tools, the CA, and the Repository.  I
think that trying to get them to provide bad information that another
ISP will accept is also fair game.

I would rule out attacks against TCP that would be thwarted by IPsec,
and (root) attacks that takeover the machines.  In the latter case, we
have not expended resources to make the OSes secure, and I do not
think that we would learn much about S-BGP from IPsec or root attacks.
Do you think that is reasonable?


Pre-Workshop Activity
=====================

Software Installation
---------------------

BBN will be providing software to be installed on the laptops.  We can
provide a source distribution, or binary for the platforms to which we
can get easy access.  First, lets find out what the wish list of OSes
is.

Issue 1: What OS/version do folks have on their laptops?  
	 Are the laptops all i386 based?
	 (We have not yet tried things on Mac OS X.)

Several of the software components may already exist on folk's laptop,
e.g., Postgres, OpenSSL, etc.  A conservative approach would be to
install separate versions of the software (in non-standard locations)
just for the workshop.  That would reduce the chance of breaking some
other application on the platform, and keep all the S-BGP related code
under, e.g., a single directory.

Issue 2: What do folks think of this approach?
	 Note that each participant can install things wherever
	 s/he wants (except the NOC Tools location is present
	 in several config files and thus would take a little
	 more tailoring to locate elsewhere).

Issue 3: Would putting everything under, e.g., /home/S-BGP be ok?
	 Might having a /S-BGP soft link to somewhere else be better?

Obtaining IP Addresses and AS Numbers
-------------------------------------

Folks will need to obtain IP address blocks and AS numbers for the
networks in their AS(es).  The conservative thing to do is to use the
private allocations: address blocks 10/8, 172.16/12, and 192.168/16
and AS space 64512 - 65535.  However, doing so might make interaction
with other systems that are normally configured to reject those blocks
harder.

Issue 4: Do folks think that playing in those blocks is sufficient,
         or do folks think that using "real numbers" would be better?
	 If other blocks should be used, what blocks do you suggest?

Once we resolve Issue 4, we can proceed to make allocations of IP
address blocks and AS numbers for the workshop, by having each
participant answer Questions A and B.

Question A: Please indicate what size address block you would like
	    from one or more of the agreed upon blocks, and how many
	    AS numbers you would like.

Setting Up the ISP's CA
-----------------------

One needs to generate a public/private key pair for the CA, and to
communicate the public part and proof of possession of the private
part to the RIR that allocates the IP address and AS numbers.  The
latter step is often done through generation of a self-signed
certificate.

We are still working with ARIN on the way that they would like to
integrate this functionality into their work flow.  They have
indicated that they would like to use an RIR unique identifier as part
of the ISP's CA name.  (This provides some anonymity, some continuity
(given the rate of organization name changes, if BBN is typical :-),
and makes it clear that there is no significance to the Subject name
in the certificates that they issue.  Most CAs assume some pre-defined
level of liability about the binding between the Subject name and a
physical entity, e.g., a person or system.  S-BGP does not, and the
S-BGP Certification Practice Statement specifically says so.)  For
the workshop, we will assign each participant's CA(s) a name.

Question B: How many NOC CAs would you like?
	    One is sufficient, since a single CA can serve multiple
	    ASes.

Once folks have been issued their CA certificate, they can install it
and the other required superior certificates from the distributed
software into the NOC tools and begin to issue certificates to NOC
Admins, operators, ASes, Networks, and routers, and generate address
attestations, etc. for upload to the Repository.  Instructions on
performing these tasks will be forthcoming.


Testing in the Local Environment
================================

Folks should feel free to play with the components before they arrive
at the workshop, e.g., maybe connecting to non S-BGP routers in your
test lab, etc.  BBN will set up a Repository that folks can upload to
and download from before the workshop so that you can have access to
other folks' entries.  BBN will also put some "broken" entries
(expired or revoked certificates, incomplete certification paths,
certificates or address attestations claiming unauthorized address
blocks or AS numbers, etc.) into the Repository so that folks can see
how the authorization verification part of the system implemented by
the NOC Tools works.

In theory, the NOC tools should not allow certificates, CRLs, or
address attestations that do not satisfy a minimal set of criteria to
be created, and the Repository should not accept them, so trying to
get bad objects into the Repository via the normal path may be
non-trivial for the red team.  However, even if they do get into the
Repository, the NOC Tools should reject them and not let the bad
information be transferred to the S-BGP speakers.  Something for the
red team to test.


Feedback Request
================

It would be helpful if folks could keep a list of, e.g., documentation
that could be improved, additional information that would be helpful,
improvements to the tools (either functional or user-friendliness),
etc., so that we can make things easier for others.


Questions
=========

Questions, comments, etc., should be sent to Randy's workshop email
list, sbgp-ws@ops.ietf.org.
