Before we review the discussion


Throughout this discussion, keep in mind that the results of the BOF represent just one data point

In particular
Results at NANOG, for the most part, represent a decidedly North American perspective
Though not exclusively

And there could have been some (unintentional) "intimidation factor"
i.e., those with dissenting opinions might not have spoken up
although no such person (or persons) contacted me
