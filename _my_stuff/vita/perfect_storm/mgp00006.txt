Aside: On Commodity Businesses


Commodities tend toward low margins
In those cases in which the incremental cost of providing a unit of the commodity goes to zero
That is the point at which it makes sense to price your commodity just below the price set by your competitor(s)
And the "race to the bottom" ensues
Which is exactly what we're seeing



BTW, this doesn't mean that gear sold into a low margin industry itself must be low margin 
The gear just must aggregate
Think Airbus (or Boeing) and the airline industry
