Central Tenet #1


Someone learns how to run a low margin yet profitable packet carriage business 
As implied by the e2e principle

Remember that the hypothesis here is that packet carriage will always be a low margin business as a direct consequence of the e2e principle 
Note that some providers are already building "simple" networks in an attempt to lower OPEX 
Something you'll need if you want to get to a profitable low margin business

And BTW, there is the question as to whether we're optimizing these networks for the "right" thing in the first place...
80/20? (Or is it more like 95/5?)
Consider "convergence" (in the holy grail sense)
See e.g., http://www.potaroo.net/ispcol/2006-02/converged.html
