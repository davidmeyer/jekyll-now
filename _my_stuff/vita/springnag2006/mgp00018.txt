So, what design principles do we have?


Simplicity Principle: 
Complexity is the primary mechanism which impedes efficient scaling, and as a result is the primary driver of increases in both capital expenditures (CAPEX) and operational expenditures (OPEX) -- Mike O'Dell (by all accounts)

But watch out!
Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not one bit simpler -- Albert Einstein

STTA: How does the Simplicity Principle convolve with "policy-based" architecture approaches
 and more generally, with the Internet Architecture
What complexity/robustness tradeoffs are we making?
