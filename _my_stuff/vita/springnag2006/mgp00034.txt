Central Tenet #1


Someone learns how to run a low margin yet profitable packet carriage business 
As implied by the e2e principle
Note that we also need to provide for an adequate (re)investment cycle...

Remember that the hypothesis here is that packet carriage will always be a low margin business as a direct consequence of the e2e principle 
Note that some providers are already building "simple" networks in an attempt to lower OPEX 
Something you'll need if you want to get to a profitable low margin business

And BTW, there is the question as to whether we're optimizing these networks for the "right" thing in the first place...
80/20? (Or is it more like 95/5?)
Consider what this might mean for "convergence"
See e.g., http://www.potaroo.net/ispcol/2006-02/converged.html
