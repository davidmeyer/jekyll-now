Coupling Principle


The Coupling Principle states that as systems get larger, they often exhibit increased interdependence between components


Corollary: The more events that simultaneously occur, the larger the likelihood that two or more will interact 


This phenomenon has also been termed "unforeseen feature interaction" [Doyle and Willinger]
