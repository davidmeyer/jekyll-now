A Few Things to Think About


If something like the TPS happens...
will the (Internet) industry restructure?
And how fast
cf. the (music) recording industry

And what do we tell SPs, researchers, vendors...
And we don't want to get ourselves into the situation where SPs can't make money or where the innovation engine (i.e., the Internet) is stifled -- DDC

What is the effect of the miscreant (underground) economy on all of this?
Hypothesis: Users to "secure overlays"?
