Issue 3: Inbound TE, cont


Issues raised at NANOG 35 included:

Current multi-homing is site based not host based. Host based multi-homing does not lend itself to current operational processes, as there are 
A large number of hosts,
Complex routed network, and
End users do not own network/traffic engineering preferences

Note also that TE decisions are currently made and configured at the network level
As opposed to in all end hosts
