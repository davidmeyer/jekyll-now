RIB/FIB Dynamic Properties


Is the dynamic nature of the routing table growing?
How much churn is there, and where does it come from

We might expect increased churn if the fraction of longer prefixes is growing
So do more specifics churn more?
As the table grows, what happens to the rate of change in the RIB on a macroscopic (say hourly) level?

Hint: It looks like the /24 prefixes have a rate of change which is some 20% higher than the overall total table change rate. There are too few /25 and higher to make any observations, but at sizes <  /24 the most stable prefix lengths are /16, /17, /18 and /21.
