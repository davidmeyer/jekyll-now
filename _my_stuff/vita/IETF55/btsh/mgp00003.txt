Problem Statement


Seeing a large number of DoS attacks against port 179
TCP 4 tuple easy to discover
Attack doesn't require sequence number. Why?
Just overload the RP.   So...

Conclusion: You don't have to own my router to disable BGP processing

Is is there anything (short of crypto techniques) we can use to mitigate this effect?

Well, TTL still (relatively) "hard" to spoof
Can we somehow use that fact?
