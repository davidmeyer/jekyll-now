E-model ratings/MOS Scores


We studied the ITU-T E-model (G.107)

PSTN:	100-70 
Cellluar:	90-60

Briefly, methodology:
Calls are placed at random times (Poisson arrival process), and we emulate business call duration (~ 3.5 minutes)

In the following graph...
The blue line is the average call rating 
1 call/minute for 24 hours
The red line is the 99.9% confidence interval
