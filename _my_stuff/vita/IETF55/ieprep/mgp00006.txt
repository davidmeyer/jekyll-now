So what would QoS mean anyway?


Caveat: The following graphs are for a system having a Poisson arrival process and exponentially distributed packet sizes (so I could use gnuplot :-))
And...While this isn't a perfect model of Internet traffic, it is a reasonable approximation and makes the associated math much easier

So... they are meant to show the effect of increasing bandwidth on queuing delay
And NOT to be a statement about actual queuing delay

As such, the following graphs do a good job of showing the general behavior
