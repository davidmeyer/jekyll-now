So...what happens if we wind up with...


A profitable/low margin packet carriage industry
Hypothesis: e2e principle ==> IP packet carriage is a commodity business
Profitable/low margin  ==> low complexity (Simplicity Principle)
Economics (+ Science + Technology)

No access monopolies
via Competition and/or new technologies
And policy-based network architectures fail to deliver the margins we hope for?
Public Policy (+ Science + Technology)

Large scale attacks against traditional access provider revenue streams
In the "capture-the-revenue" sense (contrast DOS)
BTW, recall the IXCs (products of the MFJ)?
Economics + Public Policy (+ Science + Technology)
