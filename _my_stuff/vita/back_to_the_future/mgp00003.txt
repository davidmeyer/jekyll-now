Introduction


So what is this event about?
Well, we all want to hear Geoff's talk

But also...the growing complexity of the Internet technology, and its implications 
On what we build
On the economics of our industry
And on public policy
And on the possible future structure of our industry
What is interesting is all of the factors have started to come together

Goal: Socialize the understanding of these factors within Cisco
