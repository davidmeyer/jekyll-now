How about administrative delay for sBGP?


So will it take longer to get a new address block routed under sBGP?

Maybe

Why?

Hypothesis: All of the various signatures involved will first have to be generated, signed and published to a local database,then pushed to some global database(s), and then copied to each ISP's own local databases, checked and recompiled, and propagated to each router...

So, are we willing to wait?
