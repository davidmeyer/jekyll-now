Problem Statement


We're seeing a large number of DoS attacks against port 179. Why/How?

Well, the TCP 4 tuple is easy enough to discover

And the attack doesn't require sequence number. Why?

You don't care if the TCP segment valid. Just overload the RP.   So...

Conclusion: You don't have to own the attacked router to disable BGP processing
