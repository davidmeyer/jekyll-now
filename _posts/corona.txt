The most salient features that all nidoviruses have in common
are:
(i).	gene expression through transcription of a set of
        multiple 3'-nested subgenomic RNAs

(ii).	expression of the replicase polyprotein via ribosomal
	frameshifting


(iii).	unique enzymatic activities among the replicase protein
	products

(iv).	a virion membrane envelope

(v).	a multispanning integral membrane protein in the virion

(vi).	possess helically symmetric nucleocapsids


The genome has multiple functions during infection. It acts
initially as an mRNA that is translated into the huge replicase
polyprotein, the complete synthesis of which requires a ribo-
somal frameshifting event (Section V.C.1). The replicase is the
only translation product derived from the genome; all downstream
ORFs are expressed from subgenomic RNAs. The genome next serves
as the template for replication and transcription (Section
V). Finally, the genome plays a role in assembly, as progeny
genomes are incorporated into progeny virions (Section IV.C).
