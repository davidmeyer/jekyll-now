Robust yet Fragile Systems? 


Basically, a system needs some degree of complexity (design) to achieve robustness, but it does so at increasing sensitivity to (hopefully) rare events

However, while a system's robustness is bounded, its complexity is not. That is, the robustness-complexity distribution is heavy-tailed.
