Amplification Principle

The Amplification Principle states that there are non-linearities which occur at large scale (which are not observed at smaller scales).

COROLLARY: In many large networks, even small things can and do cause huge events. 
In system-theoretic terms, in large systems such as these, even small perturbations on the input to a process can destabilize the system's output.

Takeaway: As your networks grow, even things that once looked small can turn out to be big!
