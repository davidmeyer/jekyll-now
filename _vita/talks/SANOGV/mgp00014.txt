Amplification Examples

Multiplication of BGP messages across the peering mesh of the Internet
For example, Tim Griffin's work [GRIFFIN2002] showing that a small amount of inter-connectivity causes the output of a routing mesh to be significantly more complex than its input.

Alarm multiplication on pseudo-wires 
Consider what happens when an 0C192 (or so) full of PWs fails

Takeaway: Look closely at aggregated and mesh structures in your networks (and organizations). They can be sources of unanticipated amplification.

BTW, you see amplification in nature all the time
