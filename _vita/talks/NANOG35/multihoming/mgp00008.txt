BTW, why bother with shim6?

Well, first note that IPv6 has increased the address capacity without increasing the capacity of the routing system
...and current multi-homing approaches clearly stress the routing system

Now, clearly addressing and routing are related
Rekhter's Law: Topology can follow addressing or addressing can follow topology. Choose one.

And finally....
Is there an alternative approach to multi-homing that does not cause these pressures on the routing system?

Now, on to Geoff to set the shim6 context...
