So what is the 10K-mile goal?


(Almost) every BGP speaker should be able to verify:
that the address space has been properly allocated
that the origin AS is valid 
that the entire AS path is valid
and what about other attributes (e.g. VPN?)
and BTW, are there security/other implications of (continuing to) throw (almost) everything into BGP?

Note that there are cryptographic signatures that will need to be checked and verified at each step

So at 10K, this is probably what you would like

But all of this comes at a price:
Additional operational complexity and infrastructure
