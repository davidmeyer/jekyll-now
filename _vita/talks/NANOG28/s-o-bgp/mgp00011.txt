How about administrative delay for soBGP?


In soBGP, the signatures and cerificates have to be generated the same way as sBGP

However, the propagation of this information is significantly different. 

Instead of relying on out-of-band databases (and their syncronization), the certificates are advertised in a new Security Message.
This means that once a new block is allocated (and the certificates created), the security information can be propagated to everyone in the system at about the same rate as UPDATE propagation.

So in theory, soBGP won't add admistrative delay
