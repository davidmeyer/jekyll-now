A commenary on SBGp

SBGP tries to protect everything in the routing system via cryptographic
means - this is everything from the allocation of IP addresses and
AS numbers, to the granting of routing authority for a chunk of
address space, to all of the BGP messages & peerings.

You basicaslly want to authenticate every step of allocating an IP
address from IANA to the Registries to an ISP to another ISP to a
customer.  And do the same with AS number allocations.  And the
same with the step of permitting ASs to originate routes to some
address space.  And then same with all of the BGP traffic - AS paths
and next hops and the like.

The goal is that a router can get a route and be able to verify
that the address space has been properly allocated and the origin
AS is valid and the entire AS path is valid.  There are cryptographic
signatures at every step that need to be checked & verified.

On the whole, this is probably what you would like, but all of this
comes at a price however - of added complexity & infrastructure.

There are a certain number of tricks you can play - thing like
basically precollecting all of the published information into one
local database and running authorization checks there, and then
only sending the router this 'precompiled' chunk of data instead
of everything.  But the router still need additional processing and
memory to be able to handle this.

Its unclear how big this precompiled information will be or how
much a router will need when it restarts - how much do you need to
cache on the router itself?  You may no longer have a routing system
that can come up by itself.

There is a fair amount of infrastructure needed for all of this -
databases and certificate authorities and the rest.

There is a whole infrastructure of database servers needed to hold
& publish this information.  And the exchanges between these servers
probably also need to be authenticated & signed.

It will likely take longer to get a new address block routed, or
routed over a new path - as the various signatures involved will
first have to be generated & signed & published to a local database,
then pushed to some global database(s), and then copied to each
ISP's own local databases, checked & recompiled, and propogated to
each router.

If you think about the additional processing & memory & storage
needed on the router, there are a fair number of routers that are
adequate for today's needs but will be out of their depth with the
new requirements.  A lot of upgrades and replacements would be
needed.
