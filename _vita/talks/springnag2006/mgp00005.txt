So, complexity...


First, realize that complexity of the sort were talking about here is just starting to be understood
Hard to quantify
We just don't have the tools (yet)

Our focus here is on the non-linearity inherent in large systems such as the Internet
These are the so-called HOT systems [Doyle and Willinger]

Recent work in the dynamical and non-linear systems field suggests that a class of highly designed systems (such as the Internet) are "Robust yet Fragile" 
Sounds like a contradiction of sorts, doesn't it?
