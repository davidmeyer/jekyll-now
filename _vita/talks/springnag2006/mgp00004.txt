So...I'll Start with a Few Observations


On complexity
What is it, how does it arise, what can/should we do about it?
BTW, I started studying Internet complexity (at least formally) when I was at Sprint
And my SVP said to me: "OK, if IP is so much simpler, why is the OPEX lower on both the FR and ATM platforms?"
Somewhat surprisingly, there as very little work that had been done the area of the comparative complexity of circuit switched and packet switched networks

On how complexity interacts with our technology

In particular, how complexity interacts with the Internet Architecture and
The economics of (IP) packet carriage, and
Public policy
