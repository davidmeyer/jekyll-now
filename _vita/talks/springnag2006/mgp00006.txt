Robust yet Fragile Systems? 


Basically, a system needs some degree of complexity (design) to achieve robustness 
But at the cost of increasing sensitivity to (hopefully) rare events

However, while a system's robustness is bounded, its complexity is not

To be a little more quantitative, the complexity-robustness curve is heavy-tailed

Let's take a look at what this means
