Amplification Principle


The Amplification Principle states that there are non-linearities which occur at large scale 
and which are not observed at smaller scales

Corollary: In many large networks, even small things can and do cause huge events 
In system-theoretic terms, in large systems such as these, even small perturbations on the input to a process can destabilize the system's output

In very large systems, even small things can be big
