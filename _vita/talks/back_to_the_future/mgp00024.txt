So what is the key takeaway here?


Complexity isn't *inherently bad*
A system needs some degree of complexity to achieve robustness
Contrast with the "simple network" [ISENBERG]

However, while a system's robustness is bounded, its complexity is not
i.e., the complexity-robustness curve is heavy-tailed

In other words...
