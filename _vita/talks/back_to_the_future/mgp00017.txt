Coupling can increase a system's robustness


Remember, complexity and robustness are related 
Remember the heavy-tailed curve?
So coupling (complexity) is *not inherently bad*
Huh?


Consider the use of link-layer (L2) indications by routing (L3)
Couples L2 and L3
But provides additional robustness to the (routing) protocol
In theory
IPFRR?
