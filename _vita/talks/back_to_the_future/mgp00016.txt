Coupling Principle Examples


Canonical examples include Van and Sally's work on the synchronization of various control loops such as
Routing update synchronization
TCP Slow Start synchronization


An important result of these observations is that coupling is closely related to synchronization 
Injecting randomness is one way to reduce coupling
Another important method for reducing a system's coupling is ensure that local changes have only local effect
