the time just presenting them [11:56:03 AM] <dward> Note that you may want to add one more short section (length comment being ignored)
[11:56:28 AM] <dward> which is ... what if you don't believe that wireline networks are like mobile/cell phone networks?
[11:56:40 AM] <dmm> so far I haven't been able to line up any panelists...it looks a lot like the early days of MPLS (no one wanted to talk about what they were doing)
[11:56:48 AM] <dmm> good point.
[11:57:19 AM] <dward> What are the fundamental problems of driving this arch into internet SP's, ILECs or RBOCs?
[11:58:27 AM] <dward> Last, "Is IMS a services architecture or a billing architecture?" I would ask that to a bunch of panelists just to get a rise out of them [11:58:42 AM] <dmm> excellent question [11:59:03 AM] <dward> I think your questions are very 'nice' but, may not lead to interesting debate as most of them are monologue-type answers
[11:59:08 AM] <dward> dunno what you wanted to happen though
