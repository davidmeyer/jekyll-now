Well, as many of you know...

Wanted to migrate to zebra bgpd for several reasons
MRT format UPDATES and RIBs
zebra bgpd has a Cisco-like CLI
'|',ping/traceroute, and dampening stats (among others) are missing
Less expensive hardware

Built the following box for this:
Supermicro P3DDE mainboard/2 x 1GHZ PIII
1.5G (pc133 registered ECC DIMMs)
40GB 7200rpm IDE disk
3ware Escalade 6800 hardware RAID controller
4 x 100GB maxtor 536dx 5400rpm IDE disks (raid 0+1)
SMC epicII 10/100 PCI NIC
Linux 2.4.10
cvs zebra bgpd
