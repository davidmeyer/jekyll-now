Is SHIMx the Answer to Multihoming?


Assumptions
All TE decisions are made by the source (*host*)
Sources and destinations have provisions for failover
Failure detection though forwarding plane mechanism(s)

Implications
w/o more specifics 
*all* destinations of a particular ISP can be distanced
*all* destinations of a particular ISP are either reachable or unreachable (aggregation)
Destinations (or intermediate routers) cannot do TE
i.e., No way for a destination to designate that a source should use the "best" path
no provision for the destination to designate secondary paths

Are there differences with IPv4?
Oh, and does complexity matter?
