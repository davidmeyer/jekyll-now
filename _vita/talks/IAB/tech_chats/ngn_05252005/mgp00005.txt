Terminology/Concept Confusion


Y.2011 has both transport and services "layers"
BTW, what's a layer and what's a stratum?
"The transport stratum is one or more contiguous layer networks"
Does that help :-)
In any event, note the confusion regarding telephone and video not being data services, where as WWW is a data service.

Hey, what happened to convergence?

Also "Application v. Service"?
For example, we would consider VoIP to be an application, while Y.2011 considers it to be a service
