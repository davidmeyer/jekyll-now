Aside: Walled Gardens - What's the problem?


Innovation on the edges forces walled garden providers to let the new service through
Their customers demand it
Canonical example: ports 80/443
This is part of the reason why the existence of competition in the access is a critical component of all of this

But then everything can be tunneled over those (now open) ports
e.g., skype
plus encryption + anonimzation
And BTW, you can't really find this stuff with, say, a DPI engine
Why, you ask?
